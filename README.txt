Game description:
The player is given 2 minutes to make as many deliveries as possible. They are tasked with maneuvering their delivery truck (don't let it tip over!) and launching the correct delivery at the requesting building. An order is visualized on the player's map with the amount of time they have to make the delivery, as well as an arrow that indicates these order locations in the player's environment.
